# AFK - A Gesture-Based Game Control System

This project uses the Python OpenCV module and Google's Mediapipe to detect hand gestures to control a car in Asphalt 8. Using the Help of Computer vision and Mediapipe's hand landmarking module we can map the keys(which is done using Pynput) according to hand movements and get 5 Main Functionalities which are as follows:
- Move Forward: Open Palm
- Move Backward: Fist
- Move Left: Open Palm and tilted to left
- Move Right: Open Palm and tilted to right
- Nitro: Tap the thumb with index finger



## Installation

Run the following command:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

- Run `afk.py`

And put your hand in front of the Camera!
